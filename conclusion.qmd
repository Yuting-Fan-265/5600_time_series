The study of changes over time within the freight transportation industry has provided a thorough understanding of its dynamics across various sectors. By utilizing extensive time series data and a diverse range of analytical methods, several essential insights have emerged, shaping our comprehension of the domestic and international freight movement, the industry's economic contributions, and the stock performance of major players.

**Section 1: Domestic Freight Movement:**

*Analyzing Freight Values and Weights:* The examination of freight transport values in the United States across different modes has provided valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of the industry. The dominance of truck transport underscores its critical role in the movement of goods within the United States.

*Trend in Freight Volume:* The examination of freight movement across different distances has highlighted interesting patterns, with shorter-distance freight movements being more prevalent. This trend suggests potential implications for infrastructure development and logistics planning, emphasizing the importance of efficient last-mile delivery solutions.

**Section 2: International Freight Trade:**

*Temporal Dynamics:* The exploration of dynamics in US international freight trade has revealed the industry's resilience during disruptions, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite challenges, an upward trend in freight trade values post-2020 indicated a recovery and adaptation within the industry.
Regional and Modal Variations: The examination of regional and modal variations in international freight flows has provided nuanced insights into global interconnectedness and shifting transportation preferences. Notable changes, such as the gradual dominance of air transport over vessel transport in certain regions, underscored evolving trade patterns and infrastructure developments.

*Impact of External Factors:* Fuel prices and the Transportation Services Index (TSI) have emerged as significant drivers influencing freight values within the international freight sector. Utilizing the SARIMAX model, correlations between fuel prices, TSI, and the values of Canadian freight were examined, revealing seasonal fluctuations and their anticipated impact on future trends. The analysis indicated that both fuel prices and TSI exhibited correlations with the freight value, with seasonal fluctuations being observed. Moreover, the forecast suggested a decreasing trend in Canada's freight value over the next three years, highlighting the importance of considering external factors in understanding freight dynamics.

**Section 3: Contribution to the US Economy:**

*Long-term Trend in Contribution to GDP:* Our analysis illustrates how the freight transportation industry has shaped the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the years. Sectors such as household, trucking, and others have experienced significant growth, collectively contributing around 70% to the GDP in the freight transportation industry. Despite stable contributions from modes like pipeline, rail, and water transport, air freight showcased substantial growth until 2020, followed by a period of decline and gradual recovery in 2021. This underscores the industry's economic significance and resilience in navigating challenges.

*Employment Dynamics and Revenue Trends:* Exploration of employment dynamics within the transportation sector has revealed a subtle decreasing trend in air transportation employment over the next 12 months. Similarly, the forecast has indicated an ascending trend in the US freight Transportation Services Index (TSI) over the ensuing 12 months. However, these forecasts appeared excessively smooth, lacking the expected fluctuations, which may indicate potential limitations in capturing the full complexity of the data. 

*Interplay between Economic Indicators:* By examining the dynamics between GDP, revenue, and employment within the air industry, we aimed to uncover the industry's economic performance and its effects on employment trends. While the first VAR model adequately captured the trend of the original data, showcasing relatively stable or flat trends in variables like fuel prices and employment, it struggled to capture seasonality. The second VAR model exhibited fluctuations in variables like employment and air cargo volumes, indicating mutual influence between these factors. However, the third VAR model, despite considering GDP, revenue, and employment, failed to adequately capture the trend of the original data, suggesting potential areas for further refinement and analysis.

**Section 4: Stock Performance:**

*Resilience During Economic Downturns:* The analysis of stock performance during economic recessions, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic, has shed light on the industry's resilience and adaptability. Major players like UPS have demonstrated robust performance, reflecting their ability to navigate challenging economic landscapes and meet increased demand for delivery services.

*Relationship with External Factors:* The correlation between UPS stock prices and new COVID-19 cases has been examined, revealing a negative relationship between the two. This implies that as new COVID-19 cases increase, UPS stock prices decrease, indicating the vulnerability of the industry to external factors.
