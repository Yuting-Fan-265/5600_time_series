![](images/Modes-of-Freight.webp)

## Topic Explanation

Over the past few years, the freight transportation landscape in the United States has undergone significant changes, driven by various factors such as globalization, rapid technological advancements, and evolving consumer demands. These dynamic shifts have fundamentally altered the fundamentals of the freight transportation industry, making it crucial to conduct a comprehensive exploration through the lens of time series data. 

This analysis aims to unravel the intricacies of the industry's evolution by considering the temporal dimensions that contribute to its multifaceted nature. To achieve this, advanced time series analysis techniques will be employed to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and pivotal moments that have shaped its trajectory. This in-depth analysis will provide a detailed understanding of the industry's historical development and its current state, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for the future.

## Big Picture

This exploration focuses on unraveling the temporal evolution of the freight trasportation industry across multiple sectors, utilizing comprehensive time series data. The first sector analyzes domestic freight movement, considering changes in values and weights of shipments across different transportation modes within the United States. The second sector takes a global perspective, focusing on the temporal dynamics of U.S. international freight trade. The third sector examines the industry's contribution to the U.S. economy over time, analyzing the long-term trend in the freight industry's impact on the nation's GDP and employment dynamics. The fourth sector delves into the stock performance of key industry players during economic downturns, aiming to shed light on the adaptability and resilience of the U.S. freight transportation industry in challenging economic landscapes.

## Analytical Angles

This exploration is designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the U.S. freight transportation industry's dynamics. By addressing these key questions, I seek to contribute to a holistic perspective on how the industry has evolved and adapted to various economic and global shifts in recent years.

### Sector 1: Moving Goods in the United States

In this sector, I delve into the changes in shipments over time, scrutinizing the values and weights across diverse freight transportation modes. Additionally, I will analyze the overall trend in freight volume, considering shifts in distance, to provide a comprehensive understanding of how goods move within the United States.

### Sector 2: International Freight

The international dimension of freight trade is investigated in this sector. I want to assess how the value of international freight trade in the U.S. has evolved across different transportation modes. Furthermore, explore regional and modal variations in international freight flows, unraveling patterns that shape the global interconnectedness of the U.S. freight industry.

### Sector 3: Contribution to the U.S. Economy

This sector focuses on the industry's contributions to the U.S. economy. I will examine the long-term trend in the U.S. Freight Industry's contribution to the nation's GDP, providing insights into its economic significance. Additionally, scrutinize the employment dynamics within the transportation sector, track the average revenue generated from freight services, and explore the impact of fuel price fluctuations on overall revenue. The U.S. Transportation Services Index is investigated to understand how it reflects changes in freight movement patterns over time.

### Sector 4: Changes in the Most Vital Stocks

The final sector delves into the stock performance of the industry's major players during economic recessions, particularly those triggered by the recent global pandemic. By analyzing how these vital stocks responded to challenging economic periods, I aim to gain valuable insights into the industry's resilience and adaptability.
